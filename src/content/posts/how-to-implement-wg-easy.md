Welcome to the **not** so ultimate guide on setting up wg-easy on your VPS. If you've ever wondered on how to spin up a VPN in matter of minutes, you're in the right place. This setup is suitable if you want a private gateway to access internal tools, databases or services hosted on your VPS.

## Why You Need a VPN for Private Resources?

Imagine you’ve deployed critical services on your VPS—like a private database, internal API, or admin dashboard. The last thing you want is to expose these sensitive services to the public internet. That’s where a **VPN** shines:
1. **Secure Access**: Only authenticated users can access private resources.
2. **Isolated Network**: VPNs keep your services on a private network, away from prying eyes.
3. **Convenience**: Once connected to the VPN, you can use private services just like they’re on your local network.

Try to imagine (again) for this scenario

![How it works](/assets/posts/how-to-implement-wg-easy/how-it-works.webp)

Let's say there are two employees working at Eeveel Company. Eric works in the Sales department, and John works in the HR department. The company operates from 9 AM to 5 PM, but because both Eric and John have tasks that are not yet completed, they need to continue working from home to finish their assignments.

Instead of accessing Eeveel Company's private resources directly through the public network, the IT administrator provides them with WireGuard VPN profiles (wg-profiles) to securely access their respective department's private network. This ensures that each employee can only access resources based on their role and department.

By using this setup, the company's private resources remain secure and are not exposed to the public network. Both Eric and John can access the private network as if they were in the office, connected to the local network via LAN or Wi-Fi.

## What is WG-Easy?

**WG-Easy** is a dockerized solution that simplifies managing WireGuard. With WG-Easy, you could easily set up and manage a WireGuard VPN and they already have built in web UI to add/remove VPN clients and monitor traffic.

## How to Implement WG-Easy on Your VPS

Here's how to deploy WG-Easy on yout VPS to create secure, private network.

### Prerequisites
1. A VPS with Docker installed
2. A public IP address for your VPS or host/domain

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  wg-easy:
    environment:
      - LANG=en
      - WG_HOST=YOUR_VPS_IP_ADDRESS or YOUR_VPS_HOST
      - PASSWORD_HASH=$$2axxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
      - WG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS=10.20.1.x
      - WG_ALLOWED_IPS=0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
      - UI_TRAFFIC_STATS=true
      - UI_CHART_TYPE=1
      - UI_ENABLE_SORT_CLIENTS=true

    networks:
      default:
        ipv4_address: 10.20.1.50
    image: ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy
    container_name: wg-easy-container
    volumes:
      - etc_wireguard:/etc/wireguard
      
      # Optional:
      # - PORT=51821
      # - WG_PORT=51820
      # - WG_CONFIG_PORT=92820
      # - WG_DEFAULT_DNS=1.1.1.1
    ports:
      - "51820:51820/udp"
      - "51821:51821/tcp"
    restart: unless-stopped
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
    
  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin4-container
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    restart: always
    networks: 
      default:
        ipv4_address: 10.20.1.60
    env_file:
      - pgadminconf.env
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8888:80"

networks:
  default:
    name: wgnet
    external: true
```

This is the schema for the configuration above

![How to implement it](/assets/posts/how-to-implement-wg-easy/implement-wg-easy.webp)

For simplicity, I am using a single WireGuard profile in this example, referred to as `my-wg-profile`. The rest of the configuration remains the same, except that instead of being restricted to a specific private network, such as the Sales Department or HR Department service, my-wg-profile has access to the entire private network.

The `docker-compose.yml` defines two services:
1. **wg-easy**: A WireGuard VPN management tool with a web UI
  - `LANG=en`: Sets the language for the web UI
  - `WG_HOST=YOUR_VPS_IP_ADDRESS`: Specifies the public IP or domain of your VPS. This is required for WireGuard clients to connect to the server
  - `PASSWORD_HASH=$$2axxxxxx`: Bcrypt hash of admin password for the web UI. Use a bcrypt generator to create this hash for enchanched security. You can generate bcrypt hash here [https://bcrypt.online/](https://bcrypt.online/)
  - `WG_DEFAULT_ADDRESS=10.20.1.x`: Specifies private IP address range for VPN client. Each client reaceives an address from this range. For example `10.20.1.10`, `10.20.1.12`, `10.20.1.14`, etc.
  - `WG_ALLOWED_IPS=0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`: Determines the IP ranges that clients can route through the VPN. `0.0.0.0/0` routes all IPv4 traffic, and `::/0` routes all IPv6 traffic. I use this rule because whenever I connect to my WireGuard VPN profile from my home network, the traffic is routed to the private network.
  - `UI_TRAFFIC_STATS=true`: Enables traffic statistics in the web UI, letting you monitor data usage for each client
  - `UI_CHART_TYPE=1`: `0` disable charts. `1` line chart. `2` area chart. `3` bar chart.
  - ```yaml
    networks:
      default:
        ipv4_address: 10.20.1.50
    ```
    `networks`: Assigns the container to the custom `wgnet` network (defined at the bottom of the file). <br>
    `ipv4_address`: Assigns a static IP address (10.20.1.50) within the `wgnet` network to the `wg-easy` container.
  - `image: ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy`: Specifies the Docker image to user for `wg-easy` from the Github Container Registry (ghcr.io)
  - `container_name: wg-easy-container`: Sets the container name for easier identification
  - ```yaml
    volumes:
      - etc_wireguard:/etc/wireguard
    ```
    `volumes`: Maps the `etc_wireguard` volume to `etc/wireguard` inside the container. This stores VPN configuration files persistently.
  - ```yaml
    ports:
      - "51820:51820/udp"
      - "51821:51821/tcp"
    ```
    `51820:51820/udp`: Exposes the WireGuard VPN port `51820` on the host using UDP
    `51821:51821/tcp`: Exposes the WG-Easy web UI on port `51821`
  - ```yaml
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    ```
    Add capabilities `NET_ADMIN` that allows network-related operations like modifying IP forwarding settings and `SYS_MODULE` to allows loading kernel modules.
  - ```yaml
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1
    ```
    Add system controls `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` to enables IP forwarding, which is essential for routing traffic between VPN and external networks. `net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1` is to ensures routing is correctly marked for source-based policies

2. **pgadmin**: A web-based administration tool for PostgreSQL
  - ```yaml
    pgadmin:
      container_name: pgadmin4-container
    ```
    Defines `pgadmin` service for managing PostgreSQL databases and assigns the container name as pgadmin4-container
  - `image: dpage/pgadmin4`: Uses the official pgAdmin image from Docker Hub
  - `restart: always`: Configures the container to always restart if it stops unexpectedly
  - ```yaml
    networks:
      default:
        ipv4_address: 10.20.1.60
    ```
    Connects the container to the `wgnet` network with a static IP address of `10.20.1.60`
  - ```yaml
    env_file:
      - pgadminconf.env
    ```
    Loads environment variables from the pgadminconf.env file
  - ```yaml
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8888:80"
    ```
    Maps the container's port `80` (default pgAdmin port) to the host's port `8888`, restricted to localhost (`127.0.0.1`)
  - ```yaml
    # Networks Configuration
    networks:
      default:
        name: wgnet
        external: true
    ```
    Defines custom Docker network `wgnet` as an external network and allows multiple containers to communicate within the same private network.

Pay attention to this line of code
```yaml
  pgadmin:
  ...
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8888:80"
```

By default, docker will overwrite your IPtables, so docker will expose the service to the public IP address. By specifying `127.0.0.1:8888:80` the pgadmin can't be accessed through public IP by `219.11.11.11:8888`. Instead, it can be accessed in two ways:

1. **Direct access inside VPS** <br>
  Type this command to your VPS terminal `curl http://127.0.0.1:8888`. The output will be like this
  ```html
  <!doctype html>
  <html lang=en>
  <title>Redirecting...</title>
  <h1>Redirecting...</h1>
  <p>You should be redirected automatically to the target URL: <a href="/login?next=/">/login?next=/</a>. If not, click the link.
  ```
2. **Access with VPN Profile** <br>
  Log in to your WireGuard dashboard at `YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/HOST:51821` and create a new profile. Next, download the WireGuard VPN client and import the profile. You can download the WireGuard VPN client from here [https://www.wireguard.com/install/](https://www.wireguard.com/install/). Once connected, try accessing `10.21.1.60:80`. The pgAdmin web UI should appear.


## Final Words
Thank you for reading my blog! I'm still a newbie in networking, server management and devops, so I aplogogize if there are any mistakes or inaccuracies in this guide. I'm constantly learning and would love to improve.
